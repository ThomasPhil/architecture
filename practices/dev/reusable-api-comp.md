# Finding Reuseable API Components

All teams on the project need to first look at using components that have already been built when responding to new requests. To help see what has been built, the swagger.json files for each API have been combined into one and made available to view. 

**[Click here (updated 2/26/2018)](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ca-cwds/development-practices/master/docs/combined-02-26-18.json)** to see the swagger documentation for the CALS, Dora, and Ferb API. 

I'll add in CM soon. We'll work to make this available automatically as part of the build process. But for now, this may help both designers and developers to see details of the services that have been built.
