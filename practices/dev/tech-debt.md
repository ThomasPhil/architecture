# Technical Debt

Technical debt is a common part of every development project, but the specifics involved in measuring it are quite varied. For purposes of CWDS projects:

* Track technical debt by creating user stories in our JIRA trackers
* Stories will be labeled with `tech-debt` and using a prefix in the story title of **TECH DEBT:**. 
* For now, there is an underlying assumption that about 10% of development stories will be devoted to tracking technical debt.

Measures such as technical debt determined by CodeClimate metrics will also be explored for helping to define technical debt on the project. These methods are likely to be adjusted over time.
